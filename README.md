# Cave Story Archipelago

This is an Archipelago Multiworld (https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) implementation for the game Cave-Story.

This project uses Cave Story Randomizer (https://github.com/cave-story-randomizer/cave-story-randomizer)

## Installation

Grab a copy of the Cave Story Randomizer; you'll really only need the contents of `pre_edited_cs`

Launch either from the Archipelago Launcher or CaveStoryClient.py. You'll be prompted to point to the Cave Story exe, which is in `pre_edited_cs/freeware/Doukutsu.exe`
