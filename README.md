# Cave Story Archipelago

This is an Archipelago Multiworld (https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) implementation for the game Cave-Story.

This project uses Cave Story Randomizer (https://github.com/cave-story-randomizer/cave-story-randomizer)

## Installation

Grab a copy of the Cave Story Randomizer; you'll really only need the contents of `pre_edited_cs`

Launch CaveStoryClient.py. You'll be prompted to point to the root directory of `pre_edited_cs`

## Known Issues

Syncing doesn't work; sent items won't be received if the client isn't running
